- Did you know Go can automatically check your code for some common problems? It's a great idea to run [`go vet`](https://golang.org/cmd/vet/) every so often. Try it on your code now: for example, `go vet two_fer.go`; it will make some useful suggestions for you. Some editors (for example, Visual Studio Code) can run `go vet` for you automatically every time you save; check the documentation for your editor to see how to do this.
