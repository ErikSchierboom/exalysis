- You are using a mutex to synchronize your map writes. A mutex will lose you most of the benefits of concurrency, because it forces all the goroutines to queue up waiting to enter the critical section of code protected by the mutex. There's no point using concurrent goroutines if you're going to force them all to execute sequentially! Instead, try using a channel to pass the results back from the goroutines. Channels are inherently concurrency-safe, so you can send and receive on a channel without needing a mutex to prevent data races.

(Channels aren't the answer to everything; sometimes you do need to protect concurrent access to a single piece of shared memory, and a mutex is ideal for this. In general, though, as a Go proverb reminds us, "Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating".)
