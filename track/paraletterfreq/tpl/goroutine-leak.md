- A good rule of thumb with goroutines is that whenever you start one, you should know how it's going to finish. Your goroutine here has no termination condition and so will run forever in the background. This is a so-called _goroutine leak_; a long-running program with a goroutine leak will gradually accumulate more and more useless goroutines until it runs out of resources and crashes.
