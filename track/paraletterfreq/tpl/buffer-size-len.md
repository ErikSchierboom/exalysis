- Using a buffered channel is a good idea, and will prevent goroutines from blocking when sending to the channel. However, the buffer doesn't need as many slots as there are goroutines, because we will be able to start receiving from the channel while some goroutines are still sending to it. The exact optimal buffer size depends on the relative speed of the senders and receivers, and you can use trial and error to determine this, but for most purposes a small fixed size (say 10) is just fine.
